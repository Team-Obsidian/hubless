<h3>You scream and shut your eyes as the zombie reaches for your neck. As darkness washes over, you prepare yourself for the inevitable to come and take you. But a pause of silence turns into a long moment which seems to drag on to a suffocating choke. You open your eyes and are first disoriented at the brightness of the sun, and then by the disappearance of the zombie.</h3>
<h3>The disappearance doesn't last for long, however. Your astonishment grows when your eyes move to the dead body lying on the mushy grounds.</h3>
