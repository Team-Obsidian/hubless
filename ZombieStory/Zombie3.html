<h3>You freeze as the zombie strikes, fearing to move a single inch of your body. Unable to process an escape plan, you execute no actions.</h3>
-give false hope.. of life. Black screen ((looks like you are blinking)) scrolls on for a while before leading to a pleasant surprise-
<h3>You feel something tear through your skin, not exactly sure of where the coldness is coming from. You hear someone scream, only to realize the sound came from your very own throat. In the matter of seconds, the zombie's long nails retreat from your skin, and a disturbing groan comes out of its mouth, before toppling over. The zombie falls down, and a blurry figure stands several feet in the distance.. walking over? You can't tell.. so you take a step closer to the silluette. You feel a sudden weight disperse to all your limbs, and as your thoughts fade you, too, begin to fall to the ground.
-how gory can this be? Trigger warnings?-
-link to FreezeDeath, titled "continuation" or something very highly extremely unsuspicious .. no not sarcastic, some name that's actually not shady- </h3>
